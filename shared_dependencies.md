Shared dependencies between the generated files:

1. `views.py` and `urls.py` share the dependency `django.urls`.
2. `models.py` shares the dependency `django.db.models`.
3. `index.html` shares the dependency `django.template`.
4. `css/`, `js/`, `images/`, `media/`, `fonts/`, `files/`, and `other/` directories share the dependency `django.contrib.staticfiles`.
5. The entire Django app shares the dependency `django`.

Additionally, the Django app may also have dependencies on PostgreSQL for the database, but since it is not explicitly mentioned which files will have these dependencies, we cannot determine the specific shared dependencies related to PostgreSQL.
